##Assembly
###Node
1. Begin by cutting out the pattern found here from the piece of plastic
2. Drill out the 1/8" holes
3. Attach the USB hub to the four holes in the bottom right corner with four zip ties with the ports facing right and up
4. Attach the standoffs to the plastic using two 4-40 screws in the holes in the top center
5. Attach the Raspberry Pi to the standoffs using the other two 4-40 screws
6. Plug the USB A to miniB cable into a USB port on the Raspberry Pi
7. Plug the other end of the USB A to miniB cable into the top of the USB hub
8. Plug the USB to microB cable into the microB connector on the Raspberry Pi
9. Plug the other end of the USB A to microB cable into the right side of the USB hub
10. Plug the Syba Audio Interface into the USB hub
11. Plug the Wi-Pi WiFi Dongle into the USB hub
12. Drill the two holes for the external connectors with the pattern found here and the 41/64" drill bit
13. Cut off 1' of the USB hub power cord from the connector
14. Separate and strip the ends of both of the wires of the USB hub power cord that was just cut
15. Tin the wire ends with solder
16. Solder the middle pin (pin 2) of the LM7805 to the pin on the 2-pin EN3 female panel connector with the small dot next to it (pin 1)
17. Solder the left pin (pin 1) of the LM7805 to the other pin on the panel connector
18. Check which conductor of the power cable connects to the outside of the barrel conenctor using the multimeter in continuity or resistance mode
19. Solder that conductor to the middle pin of the LM7805
20. Solder the other conductor to the empty pin (pin3) of the LM7805
21. Cut off a foot of cable including the male 3.5 mm plug from the microphone extension cable
22.
