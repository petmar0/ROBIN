###Recording and Observing Bioacoustic Identifying Node
The basic idea of this system is two-fold: to create a device that will allow for individuals interested in the detection and identification of birds on a citizen science level to assemble their own unit and use it, and to develop the software to be used on this system to do the detection and classification of organisms by signal characteristics. To accomplish this, the system must have several characteristics. It must be:
- Inexpensive (<$200)
- Modular, such that parts that are preexisting may be used
- Open-source, to allow for collaborative improvements
- Fully supported, both on the engineering and biological sides, to answer users’ questions
- Easy to assemble
- Easy to initialize
- Easy to use
Additionally, from the scientific standpoint, several other features should be included for use in the field:
- Low-power, i.e. capable of being powered by a single 10 W solar panel and battery
- Weatherproof, i.e. IP67 rated or better and capable of operation from -20 to 50 °C
- Remotely accessible for data, i.e. accessible via cellular modem
This makes it possible to create two or more models of the device. In the simplest version, a user who wishes to identify birds at their bird feeders will string a microphone out through a window, install the software on an old laptop, and run this with the screen off, pushing data to a centralized database on a server at CLO. In the more advanced embodiment, a scientist wishing to record night flight calls of various passerines will have a single-board computer sealed in a box with a cellular modem, and connected to at least one microphone outside the enclosure via a waterproof connector.
In the two aforementioned scenarios, each unit is tailored to its application in the hardware domain, keeping hardware costs as low as possible. In the meantime, this adaptable hardware may be coupled with the same software in both cases to run near-realtime detection and report classified detections back to a centralized database.
